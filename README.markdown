Outpatient is a simple patient registration application written in Ruby on Rails and is intended as a web front end for OpenMRS.

OpenMRSÂ® is a community-developed, open-source, enterprise electronic medical record system framework. We've come together to specifically respond to those actively building and managing health systems in the developing world, where AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria afflict the lives of millions. Our mission is to foster self-sustaining health information technology implementations in these environments through peer mentorship, proactive collaboration, and a code base that equals or surpasses proprietary equivalents. You are welcome to come participate in the community, whether by implementing our software, or contributing your efforts to our mission!

Outpatient was built by Baobab Health and Partners in Health in Malawi, Africa. It is licensed under the Mozilla Public License.
